# Module: unittest

## Overview

Python unit testing framework, based on Erich Gamma's JUnit and Kent Beck's
Smalltalk testing framework (used with permission).

This module contains the core framework classes that form the basis of
specific test cases and suites (TestCase, TestSuite etc.), and also a
text-based utility class for running the tests and reporting the results
 (TextTestRunner).

Simple usage:

    import unittest

    class IntegerArithmeticTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def testAdd(self):  # test method names begin with 'test'
            self.assertEqual((1 + 2), 3)
            self.assertEqual(0 + 1, 1)
        def testMultiply(self):
            self.assertEqual((0 * 10), 0)
            self.assertEqual((5 * 8), 40)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
