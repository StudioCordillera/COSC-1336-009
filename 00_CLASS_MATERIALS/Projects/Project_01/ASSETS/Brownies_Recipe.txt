0.5 cup unsalted butter, melted and cool
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
0.25 teaspoon baking soda
0.25 teaspoon salt
0.5 cup flour
0.5 cup cocoa powder
1.5 cups of chocolate chips


Preheat oven to 350F, and line a 9"x 9" metal baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Melt 0.5 cups of butter on the stove-top or in the microwave in 20s intervals. Let it cool slightly.

TIP: Be sure butter mixture is not too hot before whisking in the eggs, otherwise you will risk cooking the eggs!

Whisk together the melted butter, 1 cup of granulated sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Then whisk in 2 large eggs, and mix until incorporated fully. 

Add 0.25 teaspoons of baking soda and salt, then add 0.5 cups of flour and cocoa powder to the wet ingredients. Stir until incorporated into batter, DON'T OVER STIR! 

Fold in the chocolate chips into the brownie batter.

The batter will be thick. Spread it into the prepared pan and bake @ 350F for 25-30m. 

Let cool for 30m before cutting.
