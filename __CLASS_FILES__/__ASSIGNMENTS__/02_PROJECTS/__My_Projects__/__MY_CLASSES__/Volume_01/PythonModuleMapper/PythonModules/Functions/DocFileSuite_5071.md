# Function: DocFileSuite()

## Overview

A unittest suite for one or more doctest files.

The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
"module_relative".

A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

module_relative
  If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
  interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
  default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
  directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
  they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
  "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
  segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
  begin with "/").

  If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
  interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
  or relative (to the current working directory).

package
  A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
  should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
  If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
  directory is used as the base directory for module relative
  filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
  "module_relative" is False.

setUp
  A set-up function.  This is called before running the
  tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
  object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
  globs attribute of the test passed.

tearDown
  A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
  tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
  object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
  globs attribute of the test passed.

globs
  A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

optionflags
  A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.

parser
  A DocTestParser (or subclass) that should be used to extract
  tests from the files.

encoding
  An encoding that will be used to convert the files to unicode.
