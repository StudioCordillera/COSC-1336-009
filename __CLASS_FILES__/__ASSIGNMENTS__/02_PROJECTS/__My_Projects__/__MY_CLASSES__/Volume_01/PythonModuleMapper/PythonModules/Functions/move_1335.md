# Function: move()

## Overview

Recursively move a file or directory to another location. This is
similar to the Unix "mv" command. Return the file or directory's
destination.

If dst is an existing directory or a symlink to a directory, then src is
moved inside that directory. The destination path in that directory must
not already exist.

If dst already exists but is not a directory, it may be overwritten
depending on os.rename() semantics.

If the destination is on our current filesystem, then rename() is used.
Otherwise, src is copied to the destination and then removed. Symlinks are
recreated under the new name if os.rename() fails because of cross
filesystem renames.

The optional `copy_function` argument is a callable that will be used
to copy the source or it will be delegated to `copytree`.
By default, copy2() is used, but any function that supports the same
signature (like copy()) can be used.

A lot more could be done here...  A look at a mv.c shows a lot of
the issues this implementation glosses over.

```python
def move(src, dst, copy_function)
```
