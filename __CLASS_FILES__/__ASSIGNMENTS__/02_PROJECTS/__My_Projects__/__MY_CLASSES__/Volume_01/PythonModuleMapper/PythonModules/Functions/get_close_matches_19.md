# Function: get_close_matches()

## Overview

Use SequenceMatcher to return list of the best "good enough" matches.

word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a
string).

possibilities is a list of sequences against which to match word
(typically a list of strings).

Optional arg n (default 3) is the maximum number of close matches to
return.  n must be > 0.

Optional arg cutoff (default 0.6) is a float in [0, 1].  Possibilities
that don't score at least that similar to word are ignored.

The best (no more than n) matches among the possibilities are returned
in a list, sorted by similarity score, most similar first.

>>> get_close_matches("appel", ["ape", "apple", "peach", "puppy"])
['apple', 'ape']
>>> import keyword as _keyword
>>> get_close_matches("wheel", _keyword.kwlist)
['while']
>>> get_close_matches("Apple", _keyword.kwlist)
[]
>>> get_close_matches("accept", _keyword.kwlist)
['except']

```python
def get_close_matches(word, possibilities, n, cutoff)
```
