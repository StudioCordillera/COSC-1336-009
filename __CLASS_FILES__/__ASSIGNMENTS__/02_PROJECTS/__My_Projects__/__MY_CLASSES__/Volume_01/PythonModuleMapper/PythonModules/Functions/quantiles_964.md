# Function: quantiles()

## Overview

Divide *data* into *n* continuous intervals with equal probability.

Returns a list of (n - 1) cut points separating the intervals.

Set *n* to 4 for quartiles (the default).  Set *n* to 10 for deciles.
Set *n* to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that
separate *data* in to 100 equal sized groups.

The *data* can be any iterable containing sample.
The cut points are linearly interpolated between data points.

If *method* is set to *inclusive*, *data* is treated as population
data.  The minimum value is treated as the 0th percentile and the
maximum value is treated as the 100th percentile.

```python
def quantiles(data)
```
