# Function: sendfile()

## Overview

sendfile(file[, offset[, count]]) -> sent

Send a file until EOF is reached by using high-performance
os.sendfile() and return the total number of bytes which
were sent.
*file* must be a regular file object opened in binary mode.
If os.sendfile() is not available (e.g. Windows) or file is
not a regular file socket.send() will be used instead.
*offset* tells from where to start reading the file.
If specified, *count* is the total number of bytes to transmit
as opposed to sending the file until EOF is reached.
File position is updated on return or also in case of error in
which case file.tell() can be used to figure out the number of
bytes which were sent.
The socket must be of SOCK_STREAM type.
Non-blocking sockets are not supported.

```python
def sendfile(self, file, offset, count)
